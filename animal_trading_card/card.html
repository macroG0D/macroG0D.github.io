			<p>I remember the day when I first time saw him. He was just a homeless dog from the street. A few days before, my best friend found him on the street. To be honest, not realy on the street... The dog entered to some restaurant in which my friend was at that moment and started jumping from table to table trying to steal some food from the visitors. Before the place manager called the police, my friend took this dog home, and from there, Jay became a great part of our friendship.
